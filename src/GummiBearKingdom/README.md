* Database should be written code-first, with clear migration instruction
* The required functionality must be present by the end of class Friday 02/10/17
* The project should be in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* The project demonstrate understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, be ready to discuss our code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.

## Site inspiration:
* Link: https://www.sweetworcester.com/menus/
* What and why: I like the concept of a background fixed picture with a plain color text box on it. I did follow the concept but not the colors or the headers as my page did not required that much components.
